# MathPad "Fort Myers"

MathPad was an idea to recreate HP's CalcPad device with modern components and design. The codename "Fort Myers" was chosen because the entire project was designed during the business trip to the Fort Myers area for work in Fort Myers Beach. The device was developed with the idea of that it would be used with the Xactimate estimating software.

The project was the first of CTCL's circuit design projects to reach the assembly stage; PCB and components ordered and received.

The project was likely abandoned in December 2022 due to the lack of equipment and skills required to solder the tiny, delicate components. The project was officially canceled on January 19, 2024 after the introduction of an off-the-shelf product, the Logitech G600 MMO mouse into my workflow in January 2023. This project was made with the idea of necessity as I was expected to start having to use Xactimate after the conclusion of the business trip.

On January 19, 2024, I released whatever work I had done for the project. The existing components ordered may be reused for other projects.
